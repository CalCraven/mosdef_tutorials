# MoSDeF: A Molecular Simulation and Design Framework
MoSDeF consists of a collection of Python packages aimed at facilitating the
creation, atom-typing, and simulation of molecular models - with a particular
focus on facilitating screening over large structural parameter spaces.

MoSDeF is founded around two core Python packages:

* [mBuild](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/mbuild): A hierarchical, component-based
molecule builder
* [Foyer](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/foyer): A package for atom-typing as well as applying and disseminating forcefields

## Tutorials
This repository features a series of tutorials and examples to help new users get
familiarized with the MoSDeF toolkit. These tutorials/examples are organzied as
